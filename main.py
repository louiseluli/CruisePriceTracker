Main entry point for the Cruise Price Tracker application.

This script will orchestrate the different components of the application:
1. Trigger the web scrapers to collect cruise data.
2. Store the collected data in the database.
3. Perform analysis on the data to find deals.
4. Send alerts based on user-defined criteria.
